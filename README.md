# 🚨 Disaster Rescue Coordination System

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project simulates a disaster rescue system using Linux system calls and IPC mechanisms. It demonstrates how multiple processes communicate and coordinate in real-time to handle disaster events and assign rescue teams based on severity and zone.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* Multi-process system (C1, C2, C3)
* Multi-threading with pthreads
* IPC mechanisms:
  * Message Queue (C1 → C2)
  * FIFO Pipe (C2 → C3)
  * Shared Memory + Semaphore (C3 for stats)
* Real-time disaster monitoring and logging
* Signal Handling (SIGUSR1 triggers emergency snapshot)

---

## 🎯 Scenario

In real-world systems (IoT / Smart Cities / Industrial Monitoring), disasters like:
- Fire
- Flood
- Gas Leak
- Earthquake

must be detected and handled immediately.

This system:
1. Generates disaster events
2. Assigns rescue teams based on severity
3. Monitors and logs all activities
4. Maintains real-time statistics

## 🧠 Modules & Responsibilities

| Process                        | Threads                           | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **C1: Alert & Risk Manager**   | **T1: Sensor Simulator**          | - Generates random disaster events (Fire, Flood, Earthquake, Gas Leak, Building Collapse)<br>- Assigns severity (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)<br>- Sends alerts to C2 using **Message Queue**              |
| **C2: Rescue & Coordination**  | **T1: Receiver & Team Allocator** | - Receives disaster alerts from C1<br>- Assigns rescue teams based on severity (HIGH→1, MEDIUM→2, LOW→3)<br>- Forwards updated message to C3 using **FIFO (Named Pipe)**                         |
| **C3: Monitoring & Analytics** | **T1: Stats Monitor**             | - Receives updates from C2<br>- Maintains statistics (Total, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, Zone-wise)<br>- Displays real-time monitoring output with timestamp<br>- Detects critical alerts (HIGH priority) |
| **C3 (Signal Handler)**        | **T2: Emergency Reporter**        | - Handles **SIGUSR1** signal<br>- Generates emergency snapshot<br>- Saves statistics to file (`stats_snapshot.txt`)                                                                              |

| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C1**  | `mq_send()`, `mq_receive()`, `rand()`, `pthread_create()`, `timer_create()`                                   |
| **C2**  | `pthread_create()`, `pthread_mutex_lock/unlock()`, `write()/read()` (FIFO), `mq_send()`                       |
| **C3**  | `shm_open()`, `mmap()`, `sem_init()`, `sem_wait()/sem_post()`, `open()/write()/close()`, `signal()` (SIGUSR1) |

## 🔔 Signals Used

| Signal          | Function                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| SIGUSR1         | Generate emergency snapshot |
| SIGINT (Ctrl+C) | Cleanup resources           |
